# Xcanner
By: pesquerda404,
 Programmed in batch, Using Notepad++,
 This is a batch script that gives to some cmd comands
 a more graphic appearance.
 Is focused on beginner people,
 for learn how this comands work and what they do.
 I maded 2 versions more before this 3.0
 version but they are not posted because this 3.0 version is the most complete.
 This is a Windows verion, maybe within a time i will do an Linux version.
 Some Tools need admin so it's better if you run this script whith admin. 
It's my first script, sorry if it's too basic, in the future i think I will improve :)
